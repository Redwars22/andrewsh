# AndrewSH
AndrewSH is a little experiment of a terminal/shell (I don't know if it's at the stage of being called a shell already) built with Go that lets you execute commands. 

## Features
Right now AndrewSH only has basic functions such as interpreting BASH commands, executing programs, reading command-line arguments and printing the output of commands onto the screen. More functionality might be added in the future.

## Download and source code
You can download it right [here](https://github.com/Redwars22/andrewsh/releases) (currently Linux-only and Windows in alpha stage). You can also visit its official repo [here](https://github.com/Redwars22/andrewsh)
